# UBGarden: Where Allergic Gardeners Become Heroes! 🌺🦔

Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub repository where you'll find a quirky 2D game called UBGarden. In this game, you take on the role of the world's most unfortunate gardener, who is not only tasked with rescuing a lost hedgehog but is also deathly allergic to wasps—which the garden is infested with! 🐝

## What's the Deal? 🤔

Imagine this: A cute hedgehog is wandering lost in a magical garden, and you, brave soul (or just someone with questionable judgment), have decided to rescue it. The twist? The garden is swarming with wasps, and yes, you are allergic. Talk about a bad day at the "office"!

## Cool Features 🌟

### The Basics
- **Moving Around:** Every step you take costs energy. It's kind of like going for a run, except it's not your choice, and there are wasps.
- **The Wasp Situation:** They sting you, then they die. It's a dramatic exit.
- **Energy Management:** Standing still helps you regain your breath—and energy. It's just like real life after you've walked up a couple of flights of stairs.
- **Garden Variety:** You can walk on grass, soil, and even carrots. Meanwhile, those pesky wasps can fly over bushes. Who said life was fair?

### Special Goodies
- **Insecticide Bombs:** Finally, a chance for sweet, sweet vengeance against those stingy wasps.
- **Keys and Doors:** What's a garden without mysterious locked doors?
- **Health Boosters:** Some items pep you up, others just wear you down, kind of like reading a really dense book.

### Main Goals
- **Rescue Mission:** Save that adorable hedgehog (and try to remain calm while doing so).
- **Survival Mode:** Avoid getting stung to death (it's as crucial as it sounds).

## Technical Stuff (The Geeky Details) 💻

I battled with Java properties files and implemented a technique called "double dispatch"—yep, it’s as nerdy as it sounds. Fun fact: I spent an absurd amount of time figuring out why my wasp spray wasn't showing up—spoiler, it was a classic case of 'wrong folder'!

## Want to Try It? 🎮

Here's how you can get started:
- **Load the Default Garden:** It comes pre-configured because I'm nice like that.
- **Tinker with the Code:** Feel adventurous? Dive into the code and make it your own.
- **Battle the Wasps:** Try not to take it personally when they sting you. They can't help it.

## Getting Started 🚀

Here's what you need to do:
- **Make Everything Visible:** You can't play what you can't see.
- **Prevent Wall-Walking:** The gardener isn't a ghost, after all.
- **Handle the Sting:** Make sure it hurts... but just a little. We're not monsters here.

This project has been a fantastic ride through game design and object-oriented programming shenanigans. I've learned more about wasp allergies than I ever planned to, and I have a newfound appreciation for hedgehogs.

**Remember:** No actual wasps were harmed in the creation of this game... But a lot of virtual gardeners sure were!

P.S. Why wasps, you ask? Because butterflies are just too pretty to make good villains. 🦋❌

*Created with a dash of love, a pinch of humor, and possibly too much caffeine.* ☕
